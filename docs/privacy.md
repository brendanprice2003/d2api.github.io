# privacy

for destiny 2 operations, there are 2 different levels of privacy:
- things you can do anonymously (without a user account, but with an API key)
- things you can do as the user, involving the user's account (like move an item around)

there's no middle option, "things you can do as a user, involving other people's accounts"  
things are either public, or locked to only the user involved.  
so there's no need to be logged in as Person X unless it's for information/operations specific to Person X's account. [more here](privacy)

what sorts of things are private?
- inventory changes
  - moving items around/pulling from postmaster/equipping
  - plugging operations
  - locking/unlocking

what sorts of things *may* be private?
- activity history
- collections/triumphs data
- non-equipped inventory

what sorts of things are always public?
- account information
  - Bungie name
  - information about what other accounts are linked/cross-saved
- a player/character's participation entry in a [pgcr](activities/pgcrs)
- an account's characters
- each character's equipped items

things that *may* be private are configured by each Bungie.net user at
