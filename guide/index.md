# a guide to the destiny 2 API

what do you want to do?

## "i just want to play with the API"

excellent. the two major components of the API are:
- [the definitions](definitions-exploring)
- or [the live data endpoints](endpoints-exploring)

## "i know how to program, and want to make something with the API"

now that's what we like to hear.  
read up on the [technical basics](technical-basics) and then pick an [API operation](by-goal) to learn more about.

## just give me an index of subjects

okay. [a table of contents just for you](index-list)
